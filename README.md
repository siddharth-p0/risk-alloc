# risk-alloc


This is an exploratory project comparing modern risk-based portfolio construction techniques. It shifts focus from unstable Return Prediction to statistically robust Risk Management.

The project implements and backtests four distinct approaches to capital allocation, moving from naive heuristics to graph-theory-based optimization (Hierarchical Risk Parity).
